# CSE160-Final-Project

An analysis of global land designation use.

This program looks at how countries designate agricultural land area as a percent of their total land area. By looking at three years, 1990, 2002, and 2014, it computes the impact a country's economic class has on it's choice to either increase or decrease agricultural  land. It seeks to answer, if a country is designated as developing, does a change in agricultural land impact their GDP more than it would a developed country?

After entering in the necessary data, the program will compute a series of F-statistics. If an F-statistic is significant, that means that economic class is significant in that case and year, and if not, otherwise.
